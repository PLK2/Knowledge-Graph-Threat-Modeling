# Initial Setup

Objects = nodes

Each object has one or more "owners" (other objects required to access).

Each object may be ascribed any number of attributes. These attributes are the threats the builder of the graph believes worthy of analysis.

Objects that are downstream from an owner receive all the attributes of that owner.

Colors = type

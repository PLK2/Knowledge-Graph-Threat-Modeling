# Case Study: Your Home Server and Network

I created a Security Atlas for my home server and have found it extremely useful (see image below with gaussian blur for privacy).

I assigned the following color key:
- Red: Virtual drive
- Light Blue: Computer device
- Dark Blue: Operating System, VM, Linux Container, etc.
- Yellow: Backup
- Orange: Program, Docker Container, etc.

All relevant information for each object is stored in their respective text files: e.g., each physical drive has its make, model, storage amount, etc., listed. This makes it not only a great security assessment tool but also a general management tool.

More info to come...

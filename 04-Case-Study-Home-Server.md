# Case Study: Your Home Server and Network

I created a Security Atlas for my home server and have found it extremely useful (see image below with gaussian blur for privacy).

The color key for the graph is:
- Red: Virtual drive
- Light Blue: Computer device
- Dark Blue: Operating System, VM, Linux Container, etc.
- Yellow: Backup
- Orange: Program, Docker Container, etc.
- Grey: everything else

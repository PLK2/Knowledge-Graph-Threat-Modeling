# Network Atlas
This is a non-technical guide for developing a "Network Atlas": a visual, interactive method for analyzing and stress-testing a network of nodes (their interrelationships and interdependencies) using switchable and generational attributes.
A graph of interactive nodes that allow you to audit their behaviors under user-defined stressors and circumstances.
